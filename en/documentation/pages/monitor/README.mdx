Dify provides comprehensive monitoring to help you understand how your AI applications perform in production. Whether you're optimizing costs, improving response quality, or integrating with enterprise monitoring systems, Dify's monitoring tools give you the insights you need.

## Three Approaches to Monitoring

**Built-in Analytics Dashboard**
Real-time metrics on usage, performance, and costs. Perfect for understanding user engagement, identifying bottlenecks, and controlling expenses.

**Conversation Logs and Annotations**
Detailed conversation tracking with human feedback collection. Use this to debug issues, curate high-quality responses, and continuously improve your applications.

**External Tracing Integration**
Connect to enterprise observability platforms like LangFuse, LangSmith, or Arize for advanced analytics, custom dashboards, and integration with existing monitoring workflows.

## When to Use Each Approach

**Start with built-in analytics** to understand your application's basic performance and user patterns. This covers 80% of monitoring needs for most applications.

**Add conversation logging** when you need to debug specific user issues or want to build a curated library of high-quality responses through annotations.

**Integrate external tracing** when you have enterprise observability requirements, need custom dashboards, or want to correlate AI application metrics with broader system monitoring.

## Key Monitoring Capabilities

**Performance Tracking:** Response times, token throughput, and system health metrics help identify performance issues before they affect users.

**Cost Monitoring:** Token usage and pricing data across different models and providers help optimize spending and predict costs.

**Quality Metrics:** User satisfaction rates, feedback patterns, and annotation hit rates show how well your applications meet user needs.

**Usage Analytics:** Conversation volumes, active users, and engagement patterns help you understand adoption and plan capacity.
