Billing in Dify is workspace-scoped. Your subscription determines team member limits, feature availability, and usage quotas for the entire workspace.

## Subscription Plans

## Plan Comparison

| Resource | Free | Professional | Team |
|----------|------|--------------|------|
| Team Members | 1 | 3 | Unlimited |
| Applications | Limited | Enhanced | Unlimited |
| API Calls | Basic quota | Higher limits | Highest limits |
| Support | Community | Priority email | Dedicated support |

## Managing Subscriptions

Only workspace owners and admins can access billing settings and change subscriptions.

**Upgrading:** Navigate to Settings â†’ Billing and click the Upgrade button. Select your desired plan and complete payment. Changes take effect immediately.

**Plan Changes:** 
- **Upgrades** are prorated for the current billing period
- **Downgrades** take effect immediately with billing adjustments on the next invoice
- **Cancellations** continue until the end of the current cycle, then revert to Free plan

<Warning>
When downgrading, team members exceeding the new plan limits will lose workspace access immediately.
</Warning>

## Usage Monitoring

The billing dashboard shows workspace usage metrics:
- Active team members vs. plan limits
- API call volume and rate limiting status
- Application usage and performance data
- Storage usage for knowledge bases

## Cost Optimization

**Monitor Usage:** Regularly check your workspace's usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities.

**Team Management:** Remove inactive team members to avoid unnecessary charges on paid plans.

**Application Cleanup:** Archive unused applications to reduce resource consumption.

**Plan Timing:** Align plan changes with your team growth and feature needs.
