Plugins extend your workspace with new capabilities. Once installed, they become available to all workspace applications, letting you integrate external services, add custom functions, or connect to APIs.

## Plugin Management

Plugin installation and configuration happen at the workspace level. This means when you install a plugin, all team members can use it in their applications based on their permissions.

**Who can manage plugins:**
- **Owners/Admins** can install, configure, and remove plugins
- **Editors/Members** can use installed plugins in applications

## Installation Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Marketplace">
    Browse and install plugins directly from Dify's plugin marketplace. These are tested, maintained plugins for common integrations.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="GitHub">
    Install plugins directly from GitHub repositories using the repository URL and version tag.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Local Package">
    Upload custom plugin packages (.zip files) created by your team or third parties.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Plugin Categories

**API Integrations:**
- HTTP request tools

**External Services:**

## Plugin Permissions

Configure who can install and debug plugins in your workspace:

**Installation Permission:**
- **Everyone** - All workspace members can install plugins
- **Admin Only** - Only admins and owners can install plugins

**Debug Permission:**
- **Everyone** - All members can access debugging tools
- **Admin Only** - Only admins can debug plugin issues

**Auto-upgrade Settings:**
Configure automatic plugin updates with strategies like "security fixes only" or "all updates," and choose which plugins to include or exclude from auto-updates.

## Plugin Configuration

After installation, plugins may require configuration:

1. **API Keys** - Many plugins need external service credentials
2. **Endpoints** - Custom URLs for self-hosted services  
3. **Parameters** - Service-specific settings and options
4. **Permissions** - Which workspace members can use the plugin

Plugin configurations are workspace-scoped, so they apply to all applications using the plugin.

## Using Plugins in Applications

Once installed, plugins appear in the application builder as available tools. Applications inherit access to all workspace plugins based on the user's permissions.

**In Workflow Apps:** Plugins appear as available nodes that can be connected to other workflow elements.

**In Chatbot Apps:** Plugins become functions the AI can call when responding to user queries.

**In Agent Apps:** Plugins expand the agent's capabilities with new actions and integrations.

## Plugin Development

For custom functionality, you can develop plugins using Dify's plugin SDK. Plugins are containerized and run in isolated environments for security.

**Development Environment:**
Use the debugging key provided in Settings → Plugins → Debugging to test plugins during development.

**Packaging:**
Package plugins as .zip files containing the plugin manifest, code, and dependencies.

**Distribution:**
Share plugins privately within your organization or publish them to the marketplace.
