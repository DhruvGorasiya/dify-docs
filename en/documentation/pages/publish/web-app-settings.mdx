Web app settings control how your published applications look and behave for end users. Every Dify application automatically generates a web interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

## How Settings Work

Your web app reflects your application's current configuration. When you modify settings and hit "Publish", changes flow immediately to the live web application that users are accessing.

<Info>
Web apps work without user accounts or logins by default, making them perfect for public tools and demos.

## Branding and Appearance

Make your web app look professional and recognizable:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="App Identity" icon="id-card">
    Set your app name, description, and icon to create a clear first impression
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visual Design" icon="palette">
    Choose colors, themes, and layout options that match your brand
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language Settings" icon="globe">
    Configure interface language for your target audience
  </Card>
  <Card title="Legal Pages" icon="scale">
    Add copyright information and privacy policy links for compliance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Essential Branding Elements

**App Icon and Name**
- Your icon appears in browser tabs and when users bookmark your app
- Choose a clear, recognizable name that explains what your app does
- Icons can be images or emojisâ€”pick what fits your app's personality

**Description and Messaging**
- Write a concise description that helps users understand your app's purpose
- This text appears on the app's landing page and in search results
- Keep it under 160 characters for best results

**Visual Consistency**
- Choose colors that align with your brand
- Consider your audience when selecting light or dark themes
- Test your app on different devices to ensure it looks good everywhere

## Access and Privacy Controls

Control who can use your app and how:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Public Access (Default)">
    Anyone with the URL can use your app immediately. Perfect for demos, public tools, and sharing with large audiences.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access Controls">
    Require authentication or restrict usage to specific users. Useful for internal tools or premium features.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Privacy Settings">
    Configure data handling, add privacy policy links, and set copyright information for legal compliance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Feature Inheritance

Your web app automatically includes features you've enabled in your application configuration:

**Interactive Features:**
- Conversation openers and suggested follow-ups
- Pre-conversation forms for context gathering  
- Voice input and speech-to-text capabilities
- Source citations and reference links
- Feedback collection and rating systems

**Functionality:**
- All workflow steps and AI model configurations
- Knowledge base integrations and tool connections
- Custom prompts and response formatting
- Rate limiting and usage controls

<Warning>
Disabling features in your app configuration immediately removes them from the published web app.
</Warning>

## App Types and Behavior

Your web app automatically adapts its interface based on your application type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chat Applications">
    **Interface:** Conversation-style with message history
    **Features:** Persistent sessions, conversation management, real-time responses
    **Best for:** Customer support, consulting tools, interactive assistants
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Workflow Applications">
    **Interface:** Form-based with result display
    **Features:** Single runs, batch processing, result saving
    **Best for:** Content generation, data processing, analysis tools
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Publishing Best Practices

Before sharing your web app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test the user experience">
    Try your app on different devices and browsers to ensure it works smoothly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure essential settings">
    Set up your app name, icon, description, and any required legal information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review access controls">
    Decide if your app should be public or require authentication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor usage">
    Check app usage and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
