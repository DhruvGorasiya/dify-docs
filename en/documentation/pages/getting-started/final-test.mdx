# Final Workflow Test

This document tests our new automated translation workflow from start to finish.

## What Should Happen

When this PR is created, the system should:

1. **Analyze** the changes and detect this is an English-only PR
2. **Generate** translations for Chinese (zh-hans) and Japanese (ja-jp)
3. **Create** a separate translation PR automatically
4. **Link** both PRs together with comments

## Test Content
