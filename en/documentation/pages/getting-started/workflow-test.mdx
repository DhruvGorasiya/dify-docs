# Workflow Translation Test

This is a test documentation page created to validate the automatic translation workflow for Dify documentation.

## Purpose

This page serves as a test case for the GitHub Actions workflow that automatically translates English documentation to Chinese (zh-hans) and Japanese (ja-jp).

## Test Content

### Basic Features

The workflow should:
1. Detect this new English documentation file
2. Automatically translate it to Chinese and Japanese
3. Create a separate PR with the translations
4. Update the navigation structure in `docs.json`

### Code Examples

Here's a simple code example to test translation:

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple test function."""
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Translation workflow test"
```

### Important Notes

<Note>
This is a test note to verify that MDX components are properly handled during translation.
</Note>

### Lists and Formatting

**Bold text** and *italic text* should be preserved.

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Nested bullet point

1. Numbered item 1
2. Numbered item 2
3. Numbered item 3

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Translation | Testing | Automatic workflow |
| Languages | 2 | Chinese and Japanese |
| Workflow | Active | GitHub Actions |

## Conclusion

This test page will help validate that the automatic translation workflow is functioning correctly. Once the PR is created, the workflow should:

1. Analyze the changes
2. Categorize this as an English-only PR
3. Trigger the translation process
4. Create a separate translation PR

The workflow should complete successfully and generate translations for both Chinese and Japanese versions.
