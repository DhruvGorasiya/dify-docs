### Dify app

Dify is made for agentic app building. In **Studio**, you can quickly build agentic workflows via a drag & drop interface and publish them as apps. You can access published apps via API, the web, or as an [MCP server](/en/guides/application-publishing/publish-mcp). Dify offers two main app types: workflow and chatflow. You will need to choose an app type when creating a new app.

### Workflow

Build workflow apps to handle single-turn tasks. The webapp interface and API provides easy access to batch execute many tasks at once. 

<Info>
   Underneath it all, workflow forms the basis for all other app types in Dify.

### Chatflow

Chatflow is a special type of workflow app that gets triggered at every turn of a conversation. Other than workflow features, chatflow comes with the ability to store and update custom conversation-specific variables, enable memory in LLM nodes, and stream formatted text, images, and files at different points throughout the chatflow run.

### Variables

A variable is a labeled container to store information. You'll come across different types of variables when building a Dify app: 

**Application Scenarios**

- **Chatflow**: Designed for conversational scenarios, including customer service, semantic search, and other conversational applications that require multi-step logic in response construction.
- **Workflow**: Geared towards automation and batch processing scenarios, suitable for high-quality translation, data analysis, content generation, email automation, and more.

**Differences in Available Node**

1. The [End node](/en/guides/workflow/node/end) is an ending node for Workflow and can only be selected at the end of the process.
2. The [Answer node](/en/guides/workflow/node/answer) is specific to Chatflow, used for streaming text output, and can output at intermediate steps in the process.
3. Chatflow has built-in chat memory (Memory) for storing and passing multi-turn conversation history, which can be enabled in node like LLM and question classifiers. Workflow does not have Memory-related configurations and cannot enable them.
4. Built-in variables for Chatflow's [start node](/en/guides/workflow/node/start) include: `sys.query`, `sys.files`, `sys.conversation_id`, `sys.user_id`. Built-in [variables](/en/guides/workflow/variables) for Workflow's start node include: `sys.files`, `sys_id`.
