title: List Operator
---

The List Operator node processes arrays by filtering, sorting, and selecting specific elements. It's essential when you need to work with mixed file uploads or array data that requires separation or organization before downstream processing.

The core problem this solves: When users upload multiple files of different types (images, documents, audio) into a single array, downstream nodes can't process the mixed array directly. The List Operator intelligently separates and routes different content types to appropriate processors.

## Why Arrays Need Processing

LLMs and most workflow nodes expect single values, not arrays. When you have `[image.png, document.pdf, audio.mp3]` in one variable, you need to split this into separate processing paths for each file type.

The List Operator acts as an intelligent router, using filters to separate mixed arrays into focused streams that downstream nodes can handle effectively.

## Supported Array Types

- **Array[string]**: Text lists, names, categories
- **Array[number]**: Numeric data, scores, measurements  
- **Array[file]**: Mixed file uploads (most common use case)

## Processing Capabilities

**Filtering**: Extract specific items based on attributes. For files, you can filter by:
- **type**: image, document, audio, video
- **size**: File size constraints
- **name**: Filename patterns
- **extension**: .pdf, .jpg, .mp3, etc.
- **mime_type**: Precise content type identification
- **transfer_method**: Local upload vs URL upload

**Sorting**: Organize results by any attribute:
- **Ascending (ASC)**: Smallest to largest, A-Z alphabetical
- **Descending (DESC)**: Largest to smallest, Z-A reverse

**Selection**: Pick specific elements:
- **Take First N**: Get the first 1-20 items after filtering and sorting
- **first_record**: Just the first matching element
- **last_record**: Just the last matching element

## Output Options

**result**: Complete filtered array - use when you need all matching items

**first_record**: Single element from the front - perfect for "latest" or "primary" item selection

**last_record**: Single element from the end - useful for "most recent" or "final" selection

## Example: Mixed File Processing

Here's how to handle workflows where users upload both documents and images:

**Setup Process:**
1. **Enable Mixed Uploads**: Configure [file upload features](/en/guides/workflow/additional-features) to accept both images and documents
2. **Split by Type**: Use two List Operator nodes with different filters:
   - Node 1: Filter for `type = "image"` → sends to LLM for vision processing
   - Node 2: Filter for `type = "document"` → sends to Document Extractor
3. **Process Separately**: Images get analyzed directly by vision-capable LLMs, documents get converted to text first
4. **Combine Results**: Use Answer nodes to present unified responses

This pattern automatically routes different file types to appropriate processors, creating seamless multi-modal experiences.

## Architecture Benefits

In Dify's workflow system, the List Operator enables sophisticated array processing without complex coding. It understands file metadata, supports multiple filter criteria simultaneously, and maintains type safety throughout the pipeline. This makes it reliable for production applications handling diverse user uploads.
