title: HTTP Request
---

The HTTP Request node connects your workflow to external APIs and services. Use it to fetch data, send webhooks, generate images, or integrate with any web service that accepts HTTP requests.

This node handles all the standard HTTP methods you need:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from servers
- **POST**: Send data to servers (forms, files, JSON payloads)
- **HEAD**: Get response headers without the full response body
- **PATCH**: Make partial updates to resources
- **PUT**: Create or fully update resources
- **DELETE**: Remove resources from servers

Configure every aspect of your request: URL, headers, query parameters, request body, and authentication. Variables from previous nodes can be dynamically inserted anywhere in your request.

## Common Use Cases

**Dynamic API Integration**

Insert workflow variables directly into your HTTP requests. For customer feedback workflows, embed user details, feedback content, or ticket IDs into API calls to external support systems.

The node returns everything you need: response body, status code, headers, and files. When responses contain files, they're automatically saved for use in downstream nodes.

**File Upload**

Send files to external services using PUT requests. Select file variables in the binary request body - perfect for document storage, media processing, or backup services.

Example: Upload user PDFs to a document management API:

### Advanced Features

**Retry on Failure**

For some exceptions that occur in the node, it is usually sufficient to retry the node again. When the error retry function is enabled, the node will automatically retry according to the preset strategy when an error occurs. You can adjust the maximum number of retries and the interval between each retry to set the retry strategy.

- Maximum retries: 10
- Maximum retry interval: 5000ms

**Error Handling**: Set up alternative paths when HTTP requests fail. Your workflow continues executing even when external APIs are unavailable.

1. Enable "Error Handling" in the HTTP node
2. Choose your fallback strategy

This is essential for production workflows that depend on external services. See our [Error Handling guide](/en/guides/workflow/error-handling) for advanced patterns.

## Pro Tips

**Variable Substitution**: Dify's variable system supports deep object access. Use `{{upstream_node.response.data.items[0].id}}` to extract nested values from previous HTTP responses.

**Authentication**: The node supports various auth methods including API keys, Bearer tokens, and custom headers. For OAuth flows, consider using external auth providers and passing tokens as variables.

**Response Processing**: HTTP responses become available as structured variables in subsequent nodes. Status codes, headers, and parsed JSON are all accessible separately for conditional logic.
