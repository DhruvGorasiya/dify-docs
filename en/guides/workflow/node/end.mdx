title: End
---

The End node defines what your workflow outputs when it completes. Every workflow needs at least one End node to return results to users.

Think of the End node as your workflow's final statement. It collects outputs from previous nodes and packages them into the response users will see. Once execution reaches an End node, the workflow stops - no more nodes can run after it.

You must specify which variables to output by referencing data from upstream nodes. If your workflow has conditional branches, you'll need multiple End nodes to handle different execution paths.

<Info>
End nodes are only for Workflow applications. Chatflow applications handle outputs differently.

## Examples

Here's how End nodes work in different scenarios:

**Long Story Generation**: The End node outputs the result from a Code node that processed iterative story generation.

**Single Path**: Simple workflows with one execution path need one End node.

**Multiple Paths**: Workflows with conditional branches need End nodes for each possible outcome.
