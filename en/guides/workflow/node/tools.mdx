title: Tools
---

The Tools node connects your workflow to external services and APIs, extending your AI applications beyond basic text processing. Think of tools as specialized functions that can interact with the real world.

Unlike HTTP Request nodes that require manual configuration, Tools provide pre-built integrations with popular services, structured input/output handling, and built-in error management.

## Tool Categories

**Built-in Tools**: Ready-to-use integrations maintained by Dify for popular services like Google Search, weather APIs, and productivity tools.

**Custom Tools**: Import your own tools using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Perfect for internal APIs or specialized services not covered by built-in options.

**Workflows as Tools**: Publish complex workflows as reusable tools. This creates modular building blocks you can share across different applications.

## Setup Process

**1. Authorization**: Many built-in tools require API keys or OAuth authentication. Configure these in the Tools section before using them in workflows.

**2. Configuration**: Set input parameters using variables from previous nodes. Tools provide structured forms that validate inputs and handle data types automatically.

## Advantages Over HTTP Requests

**Structured Interfaces**: Tools provide form-based configuration with validation, making them easier to set up than raw HTTP requests.

**Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic and error management reduce the complexity of handling API failures.

**Type Safety**: Input and output schemas ensure data compatibility between nodes.

**Documentation**: Each tool includes usage examples and parameter descriptions.

## Creating Reusable Tools

**Workflow Publishing**: Turn complex multi-node workflows into single-node tools that can be reused across different applications. This promotes modularity and simplifies maintenance.

**Custom Integrations**: Use OpenAPI specs to create tools for internal services, making them as easy to use as built-in options.

For detailed guidance on tool creation and management, see our [Tool Configuration Guide](/en/guides/tools).

**Retry on Failure**

For some exceptions that occur in the node, it is usually sufficient to retry the node again. When the error retry function is enabled, the node will automatically retry according to the preset strategy when an error occurs. You can adjust the maximum number of retries and the interval between each retry to set the retry strategy.

- The maximum number of retries is 10
- The maximum retry interval is 5000 ms

**Error Handling**

Tool nodes may encounter errors during information processing that could interrupt the workflow. Developers can follow these steps to configure fail branches, enabling contingency plans when nodes encounter exceptions, avoiding workflow interruptions.

1. Enable "Error Handling" in the tool node
2. Select and configure an error-handling strategy

## Publishing Workflow Applications as Tools

Workflow applications can be published as tools and used by nodes in other workflows. For information about creating custom tools and tool configuration, please refer to the [Tool Configuration Guide](/en/guides/tools).
