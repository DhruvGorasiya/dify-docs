title: Variable Aggregator
---

The Variable Aggregator node solves a common workflow problem: when multiple branches produce similar outputs, how do you handle them consistently downstream?

This node collects variables from different execution paths and combines them into a single unified output. Instead of creating separate downstream nodes for each branch, you can reference one aggregated variable that contains results from whichever path actually executed.

## The Problem It Solves

In Dify's architecture, conditional branches create parallel execution paths. Without aggregation, you'd need duplicate downstream processing for each possible branch outcome. The Variable Aggregator acts as a merge point, collecting branch outputs into a single variable that downstream nodes can reference consistently.

## Common Use Cases

### Classification Workflows

When you classify user input and each category requires different knowledge retrieval, the Variable Aggregator combines the results.

**Without Aggregation (Complex)**:

**With Aggregation (Simplified)**:

Now you only need one downstream LLM node instead of duplicating it for each classification branch.

### Conditional Processing

Similar benefits apply to IF/ELSE branches that produce similar outputs:

## Type Requirements

**Same Type Rule**: All aggregated variables must be the same data type. Once you connect the first variable (e.g., String), the node only accepts String variables from other branches.

Supported types:
- **String**: Text outputs from different branches
- **Number**: Numeric calculations or scores  
- **Object**: Structured data objects
- **Array**: Lists or collections

## Aggregation Grouping

Advanced feature (v0.6.10+): Aggregate multiple groups of variables simultaneously. Each group maintains its own type constraint, allowing you to aggregate different data types in parallel within the same node.
