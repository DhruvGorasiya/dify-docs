title: Agent
---

The Agent node gives your LLM autonomous control over tools, enabling it to decide which tools to use and when to use them. Instead of pre-planning every step, the Agent reasons through problems dynamically, calling tools as needed to complete complex tasks.

This is powerful for scenarios where the exact sequence of actions can't be predetermined - like research tasks, troubleshooting workflows, or any situation where the LLM needs to adapt its approach based on intermediate results.

## Agent Strategies

Dify provides two built-in reasoning approaches that determine how your Agent thinks and acts:

You can install additional strategies from the **Marketplace â†’ Agent Strategies** section, or contribute custom strategies to the [community repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).

### Function Calling

Direct and efficient tool execution. The LLM analyzes user intent, identifies the right tool, extracts parameters, and calls functions immediately.

**Best for**: Well-defined tasks with clear tool mappings, API integrations, structured workflows.

**Advantages**:
- **Precision**: Direct tool calls without unnecessary reasoning steps
- **Integration-friendly**: Easy to wrap external APIs as callable functions  
- **Structured**: Outputs clean, parseable function call information

### ReAct (Reason + Act)

Iterative problem-solving through thought-action cycles. The LLM reasons about the current situation, takes an action, evaluates the result, then reasons about the next step.

**Best for**: Research tasks, complex problem-solving, scenarios requiring external knowledge, troubleshooting workflows.

**Advantages**:
- **Adaptive**: Handles tasks that require multiple information-gathering steps
- **Transparent**: Shows reasoning chain for better debugging and understanding
- **Flexible**: Adapts strategy based on intermediate results

## Configuration

**Model**: Choose an LLM that supports function calling for your selected strategy. More capable models handle complex reasoning better but cost more per iteration.

**Tools**: Configure the tools your Agent can access. Each tool needs:
- **Authorization**: API keys and credentials for external services
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what the tool does and when to use it
- **Parameters**: Required and optional inputs the tool accepts

**Instructions**: Define the Agent's role, goals, and context. Use Jinja2 syntax to reference variables from upstream nodes.

**Query**: The user input or task the Agent should work on.

**Maximum Iterations**: Safety limit to prevent infinite loops. Set based on task complexity - simple tasks need 3-5 iterations, complex research might need 10-15.

## Execution Monitoring

The Agent provides detailed execution logs showing each iteration of its reasoning process. You'll see inputs, outputs, token usage, and execution time for the overall task, plus step-by-step breakdowns of each reasoning cycle.

This transparency is crucial for debugging complex Agent workflows and understanding why the Agent made specific tool choices.

## Memory Integration

Enable Memory to give your Agent conversational context awareness. The Agent remembers previous exchanges within the conversation, enabling natural follow-up interactions without requiring users to repeat information.

**Window Size** controls how many previous messages the Agent remembers. Larger windows provide more context but increase token costs.

**Example**: After analyzing a document, users can ask "What were the main themes in it?" and the Agent understands "it" refers to the previously processed document.

## Architecture Benefits

In Dify's workflow system, the Agent node implements sophisticated reasoning patterns while maintaining tool safety and execution boundaries. The plugin-based strategy architecture allows extending reasoning capabilities, while built-in iteration limits and error handling ensure reliable production deployment.
