title: "Agent"
---

The `Agent` node gives your LLM autonomous control over tools, enabling it to iteratively decide which tools to use, and when to use them. Instead of pre-planning every step, the Agent reasons through problems dynamically, calling tools as needed to complete complex tasks.

This is powerful for scenarios where the exact sequence of actions can't be predetermined - like research tasks, troubleshooting workflows, or any situation where the LLM needs to adapt its approach based on intermediate results.

## Agent Strategies

Agent Strategy defines how your `Agent` thinks and acts. You must specify an `Agent Strategy` to use by the `Agent` node and configure the Agent according to the strategy. Dify provides two built-in reasoning approaches by default: `ReAct (Reason + Act)` and `Function Calling`.

<Info>
  You can install additional strategies from the **Marketplace → Agent Strategies** section, or contribute custom strategies to the [community repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).

### Function Calling

Uses the LLM's **native function calling capabilities** (like OpenAI's function calling) to directly passes tool definitions to the LLM through the tools parameter. The LLM decides when and how to call tools using its built-in mechanism.

### ReAct (Reason \+ Act)

Uses structured prompts that guide the LLM through explicit reasoning steps. Follows a **Thought → Action → Observation** cycle.

## Configurations

**Model**: Choose an LLM that supports function calling for your selected strategy. More capable models handle complex reasoning better but cost more per iteration.

**Tools**: Configure the tools your Agent can access. Each tool needs:

- **Authorization**: API keys and credentials for external services
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what the tool does and when to use it
- **Parameters**: Required and optional inputs the tool accepts

**Instructions**: Define the Agent's role, goals, and context. Use Jinja2 syntax to reference variables from upstream nodes.

**Query**: The user input or task the Agent should work on.

**Maximum Iterations**: Safety limit to prevent infinite loops. Set based on task complexity - simple tasks need 3-5 iterations, complex research might need 10-15.

## Memory Integration

Enable Memory to give your Agent conversational context awareness. The Agent remembers previous exchanges within the conversation, enabling natural follow-up interactions without requiring users to repeat information.

**Window Size** controls how many previous messages the Agent remembers. Larger windows provide more context but increase token costs.

**Example**: After analyzing a document, users can ask "What were the main themes in it?" and the Agent understands "it" refers to the previously processed document.
