title: Parameter Extraction
---

The Parameter Extractor node converts unstructured text into structured data using LLM intelligence. It bridges the gap between natural language input and the structured parameters that tools, APIs, and other workflow nodes require.

Think of it as your workflow's intelligent data parser. Instead of writing complex extraction rules, you describe what you need and let the LLM understand the content contextually to extract exactly the right information in the right format.

## Common Use Cases

**Tool Parameter Preparation**: Many workflow tools need specific parameters. Extract these from natural language rather than forcing users to input structured data.

Example: "What is the content of paper 2405.10739?" â†’ Extract paper ID for Arxiv tool

**Data Format Conversion**: Transform text into formats required by other nodes, like converting chapter lists to arrays for iteration processing.

**API Request Preparation**: Structure data for HTTP requests to external services, handling the conversion from user intent to API-compatible parameters.

## Architecture Benefits

In Dify's workflow system, Parameter Extractor serves as an intelligent adapter layer. It understands the semantic meaning of text and outputs JSON with predictable structure, making downstream nodes more reliable and reducing the need for complex error handling.

### 3 How to Configure

**Configuration Steps**

1. Select the input variable, usually the variable input for parameter extraction.
2. Choose the model, as the parameter extractor relies on the LLM's inference and structured generation capabilities.
3. Define the parameters to extract, which can be manually added or **quickly imported from existing tools**.
4. Write instructions, where providing examples can help the LLM improve the effectiveness and stability of extracting complex parameters.

**Advanced Settings**

**Inference Mode**

Some models support two inference modes, achieving parameter extraction through function/tool calls or pure prompt methods, with differences in instruction compliance. For instance, some models may perform better in prompt inference if function calling is less effective.

* Function Call/Tool Call
* Prompt

**Memory**

When memory is enabled, each input to the question classifier will include the chat history in the conversation to help the LLM understand the context and improve question comprehension during interactive dialogues.

**Output Variables**

* Extracted defined variables
* Node built-in variables

`__is_success Number` Extraction success status, with a value of 1 for success and 0 for failure.

`__reason String` Extraction error reason
