title: Variable Assigner
---

The Variable Assigner node manages persistent data in your workflows by writing to conversation variables. This is essential for building chatbots that remember information across multiple conversation turns.

Unlike regular workflow variables that reset with each run, conversation variables persist throughout an entire chat session. Use the Variable Assigner to store user preferences, conversation context, or any data you need to reference in future messages.

## Why Persistent Variables Matter

In Dify's architecture, most variables are ephemeral - they exist only during a single workflow execution. Conversation variables break this pattern by persisting across the entire chat session. This enables:

- **Contextual conversations**: Remember what users told you earlier
- **Personalization**: Store preferences and adapt responses accordingly  
- **Stateful workflows**: Build complex multi-turn interactions
- **Progress tracking**: Maintain checklists, forms, or guided processes

## Common Patterns

### Smart Memory System

Build a chatbot that automatically detects and stores important information from conversations. The system uses conditional logic to decide when new information should be remembered, then formats and stores it for future reference.

**How it works:**
1. LLM analyzes user input for memorable facts, preferences, or context
2. If new information is detected, extract and structure it  
3. Variable Assigner appends it to the persistent `memories` array
4. Future conversations reference stored memories for personalized responses

**Implementation:**
1. Create a conversation variable `memories` of type `array[object]`
2. Use IF/ELSE node with LLM to detect memorable information in user input
3. Extract structured data using LLM when new information is found
4. Variable Assigner appends extracted data to the `memories` array using **Append** mode
5. Reference memories in future LLM prompts for contextual responses

### User Preferences

Store user preferences like language or settings that should persist across the entire chat session.

**Pattern**: Use Variable Assigner with **Overwrite** mode to capture initial preferences from the Start node, then reference them in all subsequent LLM responses.

### Progressive Checklists  

Build guided workflows that track completion status across multiple turns.

**Pattern**: Use an array conversation variable to track completed items. The Variable Assigner updates the checklist each turn, and the LLM references it to guide users through remaining tasks.

## Configuration

Add a Variable Assigner node and configure target conversation variables with their source data. You can assign multiple variables in a single node.

**Variable**: Choose the conversation variable to write to
**Set Variable**: Choose the source data (from upstream nodes)

## Operation Modes

Different variable types support different operations:

**String Variables**
- **Overwrite**: Replace the entire string value
- **Clear**: Empty the variable
- **Set**: Manually type in a fixed value

**Number Variables**  
- **Overwrite**: Replace the number value
- **Clear**: Set to null/empty
- **Set**: Manually enter a number
- **Arithmetic**: Add, subtract, multiply, or divide the current value

**Object Variables**
- **Overwrite**: Replace the entire object
- **Clear**: Empty the object  
- **Set**: Manually define object structure

**Array Variables** (Most Powerful)
- **Overwrite**: Replace the entire array
- **Clear**: Empty the array
- **Append**: Add one item to the end
- **Extend**: Add multiple items from another array
- **Remove**: Delete from First or Last position

Array operations are especially useful for building memory systems, checklists, and conversation histories that grow over time.
