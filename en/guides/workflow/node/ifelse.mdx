title: Conditional Branch IF/ELSE
---

The IF/ELSE node splits your workflow into different paths based on conditions you define. It's how you add decision-making logic to your workflows.

Think of this as your workflow's decision maker. Based on variable values, user input, or data from previous nodes, it determines which path your workflow should take next.

Your IF/ELSE node can handle multiple scenarios:

- **IF condition is true**: Execute the IF path
- **IF condition is false**: Check ELIF conditions or execute the ELSE path  
- **ELIF conditions**: Add multiple alternative conditions to check in sequence
- **ELSE path**: The fallback when no conditions match

## Available Conditions

You can test variables using these condition types:

- **Contains** / **Not contains**: Check if text includes specific words
- **Starts with** / **Ends with**: Test text beginnings or endings
- **Is** / **Is not**: Exact value matching
- **Is empty** / **Is not empty**: Check for blank or missing values

## Example: Text Summary Workflow

Here's how conditional branching works in practice:

In this text summarization workflow:

**IF Condition**: Check if the `summarystyle` variable **Contains** `technical`
- **IF True**: Query technology-specific knowledge and use specialized LLM prompts
- **ELIF Condition**: Check if it **Contains** `science` 
- **IF the ELIF is True**: Use science-focused processing
- **ELSE**: Use general summarization approach

This creates a smart workflow that adapts its behavior based on the type of content users want summarized.

### Complex Conditions

Need to check multiple things at once? Combine conditions with **AND** or **OR** logic:

- **AND**: All conditions must be true (intersection)
- **OR**: Any condition can be true (union)
