title: Doc Extractor
---

The Document Extractor node converts uploaded files into text that LLMs can process. Since language models can't directly read document formats like PDF or DOCX, this node serves as the essential bridge between file uploads and AI analysis.

Think of it as your workflow's document reader - it takes files from users and extracts their text content in a format that downstream nodes can work with.

## Supported File Types

**Document Formats**: TXT, Markdown, PDF, HTML, DOCX - basically any text-based document format.

**Not Supported**: Images, audio, video, or other binary formats. For these, you'd need specialized processing tools or external services.

## Input/Output Structure

**Input Requirements:**
- `File`: Single uploaded document
- `Array[File]`: Multiple documents for batch processing

**Output Format:**
- Single file input → `string` output with extracted text
- Multiple file input → `array[string]` with each file's content

The output variable is always named `text` and contains the raw text content extracted from your documents.

## Common Applications

**ChatPDF-style Apps**: Users upload documents and ask questions about their content.

**Document Analysis**: Process contracts, reports, or research papers to extract key information.

**Batch Processing**: Extract text from multiple documents for analysis or indexing.

**Content Migration**: Convert various document formats to plain text for further processing.

## Example: ChatPDF Workflow

Here's how to build a document Q&A application using the Document Extractor:

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Enable File Upload**: Add a file input variable in your Start node (name it `pdf` or similar)
2. **Extract Content**: Connect the Document Extractor to your file variable 
3. **Process with LLM**: Use the extractor's `text` output in your LLM node's prompt
4. **Return Results**: Connect the LLM output to your End node

This creates a complete document analysis workflow where users can upload files and ask questions about their content.

## Implementation Notes

In Dify's architecture, the Document Extractor uses specialized parsing libraries optimized for different file formats. It preserves text structure and formatting where possible, making the extracted content more useful for LLM processing. For very large documents, consider chunking strategies to stay within LLM context limits.
