title: Question Classifier
---

The Question Classifier node intelligently categorizes user input to route conversations down different workflow paths. Instead of building complex conditional logic, you define categories and let the LLM determine which one fits best.

This is essential for customer service, content moderation, and any scenario where different types of input need different handling. The classifier understands intent contextually, not just keyword matching.

## Why Classification Matters

Raw user input is unpredictable. The same request can be phrased dozens of different ways. Question Classifier solves this by understanding semantic meaning and routing requests to specialized workflow branches.

**Customer Service Example:**

**Categories Defined:**
- **After-sales service**: Warranty, returns, repairs
- **Product usage**: Setup, troubleshooting, how-to questions  
- **Other questions**: Everything else

**Classification in Action:**
- "How to set up contacts on iPhone 14?" → **Product usage**
- "What is the warranty period?" → **After-sales service**  
- "How's the weather today?" → **Other questions**

Each category connects to different knowledge bases or response workflows, ensuring users get relevant help.

## Configuration

**Setup Process:**

**1. Input Variable**: Choose what to classify - typically `sys.query` for user questions, but can be any text variable from previous nodes.

**2. Model Selection**: Choose an LLM for classification. Faster models work well for simple categories, while more powerful models handle nuanced distinctions better.

**3. Define Categories**: Create clear, descriptive labels for each category. Be specific about what belongs in each - this helps the LLM make accurate decisions.

**4. Connect Downstream Paths**: Link each classification result to appropriate downstream nodes - different knowledge bases, response templates, or processing workflows.

## Advanced Features

**Instructions**: Add detailed classification guidelines in Advanced Settings. This is where you define edge cases, ambiguous scenarios, or specific business rules.

**Memory**: Include conversation history to improve classification accuracy in multi-turn conversations. Essential for understanding context-dependent requests.

**Memory Window**: Control how much conversation history to include - balance context awareness with token efficiency.

## Output Usage

The classifier outputs `class_name` containing the matched category label. Use this variable in downstream nodes for conditional processing, logging, or routing decisions.

## Implementation Tips

In Dify's classification architecture, the node uses few-shot learning principles - your category descriptions serve as examples that guide the LLM's decision-making. Clear, distinct categories with good descriptions produce more reliable results than overlapping or vague definitions.
