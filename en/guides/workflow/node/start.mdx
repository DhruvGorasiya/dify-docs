title: Start
---

The Start node is where your workflow begins. It captures user input and [uploaded files](/en/guides/workflow/file-upload) that fuel the rest of your workflow.

When users interact with your application, their input - whether text, files, or form data - flows through this node first, making it available to every other node in your workflow.

## Setting Up Input Fields

You can configure custom input fields to collect specific information from users. For instance, if you're building a weekly report generator, you might ask users for their name, reporting period, and key accomplishments. This structured input helps your LLM generate more accurate and personalized responses.

The Start node supports six input types, all of which can be marked as required:

**Text**: Short text input with a 256-character limit. Use this for names, titles, or brief descriptions.

**Paragraph**: Long-form text input with no character restrictions. Ideal when users need to provide detailed information.

**Select**: Dropdown menu with predefined options. Users can only choose from your preset choices, not enter custom text.

**Number**: Accepts numerical input only. Perfect for quantities, ratings, or numeric identifiers.

**Single File**: Allows users to upload one file of any supported type - documents, images, audio, or video. Users can upload locally or provide a file URL.

**File List**: Similar to single file upload, but supports multiple file uploads in one go.

<Info>
Dify's built-in document extractor handles most document formats. For processing images, audio, or video files, you'll need to configure external data tools with appropriate processing nodes.

Well-designed input fields improve your workflow's performance by providing relevant context upfront.

## System Variables

The Start node automatically provides a set of system variables that give you access to important workflow metadata. These variables are available throughout your entire workflow. Depending on the app type, different system variables may be available:
