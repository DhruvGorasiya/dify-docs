Dify Enterprise delivers secure and reliable identity authentication solutions tailored to different user types. Whether it's internal employees accessing workspaces or external users utilizing Web Apps, our flexible authentication methods ensure secure access. Administrators can configure the most appropriate authentication approach based on their organization's security policies and user requirements.

## User Types

Dify Enterprise categorizes users into two types:

**Internal Members**: Users within your organization's system, including workspace-registered members or users added through the admin console. These users typically require workspace access to create and manage AI applications.

**External Users**: Personnel outside your Dify Enterprise system, including users from other departments, business partners, external customers, or visitors who need to use your AI applications. These users typically only require access to specific Web Apps without workspace entry.

## Authentication Methods

Each user type supports different authentication methods depending on their access requirements:

| User Type | User Scope | Access Scenario | Supported Authentication Methods |
|---------- |-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Internal Users | Regular Members | Workspace | Email and Password, Email and Verification Code, Single Sign-On (SSO) |
| Internal Users | Designated Group Members | Web App | Single Sign-On (SSO) |
| External Users | External Visitors | Web App | Single Sign-On (SSO) |

With proper identity authentication configuration, organizations can deliver seamless user access while maintaining robust data security. We recommend implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) as your primary method to achieve centralized identity management and enhance both user experience and administrative efficiency.

- [Internal User Authentication](./enterprise-user-auth) - Set up multiple authentication methods for internal team members
