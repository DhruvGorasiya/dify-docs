title: Configuring OIDC with Okta
---

This document will use Okta as the SSO identity provider to demonstrate how to enable OIDC authentication protocol for Dify Enterprise.

By enabling this feature, the enterprise login page will use a unified identity authentication entry to enhance security. For enterprise internal users, there's no need to enter complex passwords - they can log in using organizational accounts to pass verification, simplifying the login process.

> This document will mention internal users and external users. The following distinctions are made:
> Internal members: Members registered within the Dify Enterprise workspace or added through the admin backend.
> External users: Members not within Dify Enterprise

## 1. Create a New Application in Okta

1. Access the Okta administrator backend page, navigate to the Applications page, and click the Create App Integration button.

2. Fill in the application name according to the page prompts and define the authorization scope according to requirements.

- The `Sign-in redirect URIs` field needs to be filled with the Dify Enterprise Callback URL. Please refer to [the section below](#2-configuring-okta-application) for how to obtain it.
- Leave the `Sign-out redirect URIs` field empty.

## 2. Configuring Okta Application

According to the required SSO scope to be enabled, **Callback URLs differ**. System administrators need to fill the Dify Enterprise Callback URL into the corresponding Okta OAuth2 application to complete the creation process.

## 4. Enable SSO Mandatory Authentication (Optional)

System administrators can enable **SSO Enforcement** options for the following two scenarios to enable mandatory authentication:

- **Workspace**: Requires authorization when logging into Dify Enterprise Workspace.
- **WebApp**: Requires verification when using applications created by the current Dify Enterprise.

After enabling, accessing the corresponding scenarios will prompt for access authorization.
