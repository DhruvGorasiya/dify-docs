title: Configure OAuth2 with GitHub
version: English

This guide uses **GitHub** as an example SSO identity provider, demonstrating how to enable OAuth2 authorization for Dify Enterprise Edition.

By enabling this feature, the login page in Enterprise Edition will utilize a unified authentication portal to enhance security. For internal enterprise users, there’s no need to set up complex passwords—logging in with an organizational account streamlines the process.

## 1. Create an OAuth App in GitHub

1. Go to the **GitHub Admin** console, navigate to **Settings**, select **OAuth Apps**, and create a new OAuth application.

2. Follow the on-screen prompts and provide the required information to create the application:

   - **Application name**: Required. You can choose any name.  
   - **Homepage URL**: Required. The homepage link, which is typically your Dify Enterprise platform URL.  
   - **Application description**: Optional. A brief description of the application.  
   - **Authorization Callback URL**: Required. See [below](#2-obtain-the-callback-url) for how to obtain this URL.

> For more details on creating an OAuth application in GitHub, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

## 2. Obtain the Callback URL

Depending on the SSO scope you intend to enable, **the Callback URL may differ**. The system administrator needs to paste the Dify Enterprise **Callback URL** into the corresponding GitHub OAuth2 application in order to complete the setup.

    In the Dify Enterprise **Authentication** page, under **Workspace Settings**, click **+ New Identity Provider → New OAuth2 Provider**, then find the Callback URL at the bottom.

    It typically follows this format:
    ```bash
    https://[your-dify-enterprise-url]/console/api/enterprise/sso/oauth2/callback
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WebApp">
    In the Dify Enterprise **Authentication** page, under **WebApp Settings**, click **+ New Identity Provider → New OAuth2 Provider**, then find the Callback URL at the bottom.

    It typically follows this format:
    ```bash
    https://[your-app-url]/api/enterprise/sso/oauth2/callback
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Paste this URL into the **Authorization callback URL** field in your GitHub OAuth application.

## 3. Enable OAuth2 Authentication

Go to the Dify Enterprise **Authentication** page, click **+ New Identity Provider → New OAuth2 Provider**, and enter the details as prompted to complete the configuration.

Retrieve the following information from your OAuth application:

- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

Different OAuth2 providers may require different credentials, as outlined by each provider’s official documentation. The following items are for reference and may be adjusted as needed:

- **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
- **Token Endpoint**: `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
- **User Info Endpoint**: `https://api.github.com/user`
- **Scopes**: `openid, profile, email`

## 4. Enable SSO Enforcement (Optional)

The system administrator can enable **SSO Enforcement** for the following two scenarios, requiring mandatory authorization:

- **Workspace**: Users must be authorized to log in to the Dify Enterprise Workspace.
- **WebApp**: Users must be authorized when accessing applications created by this Dify Enterprise instance.

When enabled, users will be prompted for authorization upon accessing these scenarios.
