System administrators can manage the team users on the **Settings** page. They have the following permissions:

* Log in to the enterprise dashboard
* Add / delete / disable team members
* Add Owners to Workspace
* Add new members to Workspace and assign permissions

## Adding System Administrators

The creator of the enterprise dashboard is the default first system administrator. Any system administrator can invite others to become system administrators.
