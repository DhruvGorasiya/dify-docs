---

## Overview

Dify Enterprise Edition supports automatic synchronization of your organization's existing structure through the [SCIM](https://scim.cloud/) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) protocol, making it easier for admins to manage large teams efficiently.

- Standard SCIM 2.0 protocol support
- Automatic user and organization structure sync
- Works with major identity providers
- Real-time member updates

## Before You Start

To enable automatic synchronization, make sure you have:

1. Dify EE system administrator permissions
2. Access to your organization's identity provider backend
3. Understanding of your current identity provider type

## Setup Guide

### 1. Get Your SCIM Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Sync Settings">
    In the enterprise dashboard, go to **Members** → **Sync Settings** from the left sidebar.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the SCIM Endpoint">
    Find and copy the `SCIM 2.0 Base URL` shown on the page. You'll need this for your identity provider setup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Authentication Token">
    - Click **Get Token**
    - The system generates an OAuth Bearer Token
    
    <Warning>
      This token appears only once. Copy and save it immediately in a secure location. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Configuration">
    Keep these items safe for the next steps:
    - SCIM Base URL
    - OAuth Bearer Token
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Connect Your Identity Provider

Select your identity provider below for specific setup instructions:

    Set up member sync with Azure AD
  </Card>
  <Card title="Okta" icon="key" href="./okta">
    Set up member sync with Okta
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How SCIM Maps to Dify

Here's how SCIM resources work with Dify features:

| SCIM Resource Type | Maps to Dify | What You Can Do | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| User           | Member (email, username, status) | Create, Update, Deactivate | Deactivating changes user status to "Disabled" but keeps their data |
| Group          | Group (name, members)        | Create, Update, Delete | Deleting a group removes it permanently along with member relationships |

## Key Things to Know

<Info>
  Once you enable SCIM sync, your identity provider becomes the single source of truth for user and group management. To learn about API limitations, check out the [Admin APIs](en-us/administrator-guide/admin-apis) documentation.
</Info>

### What Changes When SCIM is Active

**With SCIM enabled:**
- All user and group management happens through your identity provider
- Admin APIs become read-only
- Self-registration is disabled

**With SCIM disabled:**
- Full Admin API access returns
- All user management features work normally

### If You Need to Make Manual Changes

Sometimes you might need to use Admin APIs directly:

1. Temporarily turn off SCIM
2. Make your API changes
3. Turn SCIM back on and check sync status

<Warning>
  This can cause sync conflicts. Use with caution.
</Warning>
