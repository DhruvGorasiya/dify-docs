- Before activating the license, you need to change the `licenseMode` value in the `values.yaml` file to `offline`.

    1. Display Helm Chart Values
        ```
        helm show values dify/dify
        ```

    2. Set License Mode to `offline`
        ```yaml
        enterprise:
            licenseMode: "offline"
        ```
- After making the changes, return to the License activation tab, enter the `Offline Code`, and complete the activation process.
- After activating the license, you need to restart the `enterprise` service for the new license to take effect.
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment dify-enterprise
```

- The flow for refreshing the license is the same as the activation process.
- After refreshing the license, you need to restart the `enterprise` service for the new license to take effect.
