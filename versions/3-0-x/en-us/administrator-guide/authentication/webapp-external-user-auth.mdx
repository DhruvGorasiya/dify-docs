title: Web App External User Authentication
---

This authentication method is designed for Web Apps with publishing permissions set to "Authenticated External Users". External users can access Web Apps through authentication without needing to register Dify Enterprise accounts.

> External users are individuals who are not part of your Dify Enterprise system.

This authentication method enables organizations to control application access while monitoring and managing external users through third-party identity providers.

**Use Cases**

Consider a scenario where IT staff have built AI assistants for company employees, but not everyone has joined the Dify Enterprise system. However, all employees exist in a third-party identity provider. External user authentication allows these users to access applications through SSO without Dify registration.

This approach is ideal when providing AI services to customers, partners, or other external stakeholders.

## Authentication Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Access">
    User clicks on the web application link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Redirect">
    System redirects to your configured SSO login page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identity Verification">
    User authenticates through your identity provider
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization Callback">
    Upon successful authentication, user returns to the application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Using">
    User accesses the Web App and begins using the service
  </Step>
</Steps>

Configure based on your specific identity provider. For detailed setup instructions, see [Configure SSO Authentication](/en-us/administrator-guide/sso/introduction).

### Step 2: Enable External User Authentication

1. Once configuration is complete, locate the **Enable SSO** toggle
2. Switch it to **On**

<Info>
  If SSO is configured but not enabled, the **Authenticated External Users** option will be unavailable in Web App publishing permissions. Learn more about this in [Application Access Permission Management](/versions/2-8-x/en-us/user-guide/application-publishing/permission-management).
</Info>

### Step 3: Test Authentication Configuration

1. Set Web App permissions to **Authenticated External Users** during publishing
2. Share the Web App URL with external users
3. Verify proper redirection to the SSO login page
4. Test the complete login flow with a test account
5. Confirm successful Web App access
