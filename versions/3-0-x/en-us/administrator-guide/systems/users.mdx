System administrators can manage system administrator users for the current enterprise edition on the Settings page, with the following permissions:

- Log in to the enterprise admin backend
- Add / Delete / Disable team members
- Add Owners to Workspaces
- Add new members to Workspaces and assign permissions

## Managing System Administrators

### Adding System Administrators

The creator of the enterprise backend is the first system administrator by default. Any system administrator can invite others to become system administrators. Click the blue Add button in the upper right corner of the Settings page, enter the user's name and email to complete the addition.

If a system administrator's email is not added to the "Members" list, they do not have permission to create and use workspaces. If you want the system administrator to also be able to create or join a Workspace, please refer to [Adding Members to Workspace](/en-us/administrator-guide/members-management).

### Modifying System Administrator Information

Select a system administrator, click the menu button on the right, click Edit, and modify the system administrator's name or email in the pop-up tab.

### Resetting System Administrator Password
