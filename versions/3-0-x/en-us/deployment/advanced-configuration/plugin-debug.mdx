## Display Helm Chart Values

```bash
helm show values dify/dify
```

This is an example of the plugin debug configuration in the Helm chart values.
```yaml
plugin_daemon:
  serviceType: "NodePort"
  remoteInstallHost: "127.0.0.1"
  remoteInstallPort: "5003"
```

- `serviceType`
  - The type of service to expose the `plugin_daemon`. It can be `NodePort`, or `LoadBalancer`.
  - `NodePort`: Exposes the service on each Nodeâ€™s IP at a static port.
  - `LoadBalancer`: Creates an external load balancer in supported cloud providers, which routes traffic to the plugin daemon.
  - For more details, refer to the [Kubernetes Service Types documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

- `remoteInstallHost`: This is `Node` IP or `LoadBalancer` IP.
  - If you are using `NodePort`, it should be the IP of one of your Kubernetes nodes.
  - If you are using `LoadBalancer`, it should be the IP of the load balancer.

- `remoteInstallPort`: This is the port on which the plugin daemon is listening for debug.
  - If you are using `NodePort`, it should be the port assigned to the service.
  - If you are using `LoadBalancer`, it should be the port exposed by the load balancer.
