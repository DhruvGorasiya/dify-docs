title: Deployment Preparation
---

Thank you for choosing Dify Enterprise as your company's accelerator for large language model innovation business.

This document aims to help you verify whether your company's software and hardware environment meets the requirements before deploying Dify Enterprise. We hope this document will help you better understand this cooperation and efficiently utilize the enterprise-level features provided by Dify Enterprise, including high availability, multi-tenancy, authentication, and management.

Dify Enterprise is software that can run in a Kubernetes (K8S) environment. This document only discusses the deployment of a single set of Dify Enterprise. Please follow our software and hardware requirements list as completely as possible to avoid encountering problems or difficulties during deployment, or even exceeding the scope of services that the Dify team can provide.

The Dify team provides the following services:

**Dify Deep Technical Support Services**: Provides customized deployment, development, and information consulting services.

**Dify Standard Technical Support Services**: Provides regular software deployment assistance services.

If you have additional deployment requirements, please contact your sales representative.

## 1. Hardware Requirements

### 1.1 Production Environment

In a production environment, you need the following hardware requirements to test Dify Enterprise capabilities in a cluster deployment environment:

* **Kubernetes cluster**
   * 1 Worker Node: 4 CPU cores, 16 GB memory
* **Container registry (Plugins)**
   * AWS ECR（with AK/SK or IRSA）/ Azure ACR / Aliyun ACR (with AK/SK) / Tencent TCR (with AK/SK) / Dockerhub / Google Artifact Registry
* **Persistent storage**
   * S3 / AWS S3 (with AK/SK or IRSA) / Azure Blob / Aliyun OSS (with AK/SK) / Tencent COS (with AK/SK) / Google GCS
   * 100 GB storage space
* **PostgreSQL database**
   * Version 14+
   * 2 CPU cores, 4 GB memory
   * 256 GB storage space
* **Redis database**
   * Version 6+
   * 1 GB memory
* **Vector database VM - Qdrant single node**
   * 1 virtual machine
   * 4 CPU cores, 8 GB memory
   * 100 GB storage space

You can choose your own suppliers, but we recommend selecting enterprises with good brand reputation to avoid hardware issues during use.

For vector databases, we primarily recommend deploying **Qdrant**. If you wish to use other vector databases, please contact your sales representative in advance to obtain the list of supported vector databases. Currently, Dify Enterprise only officially supports a very limited number of vector databases. For vector databases not on the support list, Dify cannot guarantee their availability or stability and cannot provide any deployment support in regular services. Support for specific vector databases falls under **Dify Deep Technical Support Services**, but we cannot ensure support for your database choice in all cases, so please contact your sales representative for evaluation to avoid misunderstandings.

If you find the software functions satisfactory in the above testing and are ready to deploy the software in a production environment, we recommend preparing the following hardware conditions to ensure high scalability. This hardware configuration can support **3000 daily active users**:

* **Kubernetes cluster**
   * 6 Worker Nodes: 8 CPU cores, 32 GB memory each
* **Container registry (Plugins)**
   * AWS ECR（with AK/SK or IRSA）/ Azure ACR / Aliyun ACR (with AK/SK) / Tencent TCR (with AK/SK) / Dockerhub / Google Artifact Registry
* **Persistent storage**
   * S3 / AWS S3 (with AK/SK or IRSA) / Azure Blob / Aliyun OSS (with AK/SK) / Tencent COS (with AK/SK) / Google GCS
   * 512 GB storage space
* **PostgreSQL database**
   * Version 14+
   * 4 CPU cores, 8 GB memory
   * 512 GB SSD storage space
* **Redis database**
   * Version 6+
   * 2 GB memory
* **Vector database VMs - Qdrant cluster**
   * 3 virtual machines
   * 8 CPU cores, 64 GB memory each
   * 100 GB storage space each

Similarly, we recommend choosing cloud service providers with good brand reputation to provide the corresponding hardware.

### 1.2 Exceptions

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Dify team will not be able to provide standard deployment services in the following situations:

1. You are using local hardware (such as physical servers) rather than standard cloud service hardware.
2. Your hardware is shared with other software.
3. You wish to deploy using non-Kubernetes solutions.
4. You wish to modify existing software structure, code, etc.
5. You wish to use certain vector databases that the Dify team cannot support.
6. You wish to use unsupported hardware protocols.
7. Other situations explicitly refused support by the Dify team.

Since these situations make the original standard service process and deployment procedures unable to operate normally and must be served through customized solutions, they are not within the scope of our standard deployment services.

## 2. Software Requirements

You need to be aware that Dify Enterprise has opened up a powerful third-party software integration ecosystem. Once the transaction is completed, you will receive a Dify Enterprise user manual that will indicate methods for integrating third-party software, please refer to it. However, this does not mean that Dify will help you deploy third-party software, nor does it mean that Dify will be responsible for the consequences of your use of such software. Please evaluate the usage methods, risks, and personnel configuration of third-party software on your own before use.

### 2.1 Software Configuration

Typically, you need to install and initialize the Kubernetes (K8S).

Meanwhile, ensure your **Linux environment** is the latest version to ensure the availability of related dependency libraries. Besides these, generally no other software needs to be installed.

### 2.2 Personnel Configuration

Please ensure your company always has its own **operations engineers**, or obtains assistance through **Dify Deep Technical Support Services** to help advance the entire Dify deployment process. If you lack such support, or if you have a development team but lack operations experience, it may lead to difficulties in deploying Dify Enterprise. You need to clearly state your technical capacity reserves or deployment plan during business communications so that we can match the best technical solution for you.

**Dify Enterprise** is software aimed at large-scale applications, and technical capacity is particularly important during the deployment process.

### 2.3 Updates and Maintenance

After contract signing, you will obtain the **update method** in the enterprise version deployment manual. You can choose not to update Dify Enterprise, but your **License** will only be effective during the contract-specified time.

If software issues arise, please contact our **delivery team** for assistance. For software issues, we will provide maintenance services. The regular issue response cycle is **24 hours**; for fatal issues affecting software production capability, we will assist you in resolving them as soon as possible.

The above assistance refers to **non-intrusive** technical support, meaning only maintaining the normal operation of the software itself, not including software usage training, nor providing customized development or deployment services.

## 3. Deployment

### 3.1 Deployment Notes

**Dify Enterprise** is a software system. When purchasing the software alone, we will provide you with **24 hours total over one year** of standard technical support services. Purchasing this software does not mean you have purchased Dify's deployment services. Therefore, after reading this document, please appropriately evaluate your existing technical capacity and contact sales personnel to evaluate the technical difficulty and your actual needs, so we can provide you with the most suitable deployment solution.

### 3.2 Standard Deployment Service Scope
