The "Tools" node provides powerful third-party capability support for workflows, divided into three types:

* **Built-in Tools**, first-party tools provided by Dify, which may require **authorization** before use.
* **Custom Tools**, tools imported or configured through the [OpenAPI/Swagger standard format](https://swagger.io/specification/). If built-in tools cannot meet your needs, you can create custom tools in **Dify Menu Navigation --Tools**.
* **Workflows**, you can orchestrate a more complex workflow and publish it as a tool. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Tool Configuration Guide](/user-guide/tools/introduction).

### Adding Tool Nodes

When adding a node, select the "Tools" tab on the right. Configuring a tool node generally involves two steps:

1. Authorize tools/Create custom tools/Publish workflow as a tool
2. Configure tool inputs and parameters

Tool nodes can connect to other nodes, processing and passing data through [variables](/user-guide/build-app/flow-app/variables).

### Publishing Workflow Applications as Tools

Workflow applications can be published as tools and used by nodes in other workflows. For information on how to create custom tools and configure tools, please refer to [Tool Configuration Guide](/user-guide/tools/introduction).
