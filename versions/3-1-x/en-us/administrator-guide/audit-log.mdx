---

The audit log is used to record key operational behaviors within the system, supporting users in operation tracking, security auditing, and compliance analysis.

## 1. Feature Introduction

The audit log feature provides the capability to record and query key behaviors such as resource changes, permission operations, and configuration adjustments in the platform. The log has structured fields, supports precise filtering, querying, and exporting, helping enterprises identify potential risks and meet security compliance requirements.

**Typical application scenarios include:**

- Operation tracing and responsibility positioning
- Security policy audit and risk troubleshooting
- Compliance check and external audit support

| Workspace | The workspace to which the resource belongs (if applicable), including the name and ID |
| Operator | The member account, system user account, API Key, operator ID, and IP address of the operator who triggered the operation |
| Operation Type | The type of operation behavior (such as create, modify, delete, upload, etc.) |
| Resource Type | The resource category of the operated object (such as members, workspaces, applications, configuration items, etc.) |
| Resource Name | The specific resource name, which can be accompanied by the parent resource, for example: test.doc (TestDataSet), as well as the ID of the resource and parent resource |

### 2.3 Query Function Description

**Optional filter conditions:**

- Workspace, search by workspace ID
- Resource type, for example: members, applications, authentication configuration
- Operation type, for example: create, modify, export DSL
- Resource ID, exact match of resource ID
- Time range, by default only supports the last 90 days

**Query restrictions:**

The default query range is **the last 90 days**. If you need to query historical logs, please use the "Download Log" function to obtain complete data.

**List display:**

## 3. Download Log

### 3.1 Feature Description

To ensure query efficiency and system performance, logs older than 90 days will be automatically archived. Users can obtain them by **downloading log files (CSV format)**.

### 3.2 Operation Steps

1. Click "Download Log" in the upper right corner of the page;
2. Select the time range in the pop-up window (supports any historical time period);
3. Click "Download CSV File", and the system will start downloading the CSV file.

> - If part of the data in the selected time range is still within the online query range, the system will package and download it together.
> - The log file may be large in size, and the download time depends on the selected range and data volume, please be patient.

### 3.3 Data Analysis Suggestions

You can use the following tools to filter and analyze the exported CSV files:

- Excel / Numbers: suitable for lightweight filtering and summarizing
- Notion / Airtable: suitable for structured visual management
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana): suitable for large-scale log visualization, search, and alerting

> Tip: The downloaded log is a structured CSV file, and the fields are consistent with online queries, which is convenient for subsequent analysis.
